      <strong> Chapter I - The Spark of the imagination. </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      The concept for el niño started in 2020 during COVID.
      <br />
      <br />I released an EP titled {`"El Niño Que Grito Lobo" (The Boy Who Cried Wolf)`} I released
      a few months after my daughter was born and the project <br /> gave me some industry
      recognition but I knew there was more to build...
      <br />
      <br />
      {`The vision for el niño is to expand into character Ip, media/entertainment, a foundation, and
      a creative studio.`}
      <br />
      <br />
      As a kid it felt that I had the biggest imagination!
      <br />
      <br />
      {` We tend to lose that sense of wonder as we grow older but part of me held it close…that's how
      “El Niño” was born.`}
      <br />
      <br />
      el niño estrella stems from the idea that “stories transcend mediums..”
      <br />
      <br />
      <em>We are actively looking for collaborators to help us expand the universe for El Niño!</em>
